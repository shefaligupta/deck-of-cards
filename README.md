In this assignment, I have used ES6 to represent the class of deck and its function shuffle and deal.

Demo: https://shefaligupta.github.io/robots-and-pencil/demo

Test: Open console to see test messages.

Shuffle Cards:
When the html file is opened, you will see a shuffle cards button and ordered cards.
Hit the button to display the shuffled cards.

How are cards shuffled: We find a random number from the deck of cards and swap the card from that index.

Deal Card:
Deal card will always pick the top card of the stack. A card will be shown when you hit deal card button on the screen.
