Given Problem Statement:

Write a simple class in the language of your choice to represent a deck of cards with
operations to shuffle the deck and to deal one card. While not a requirement today, a
likely future enhancement is the need to deal all the cards in a deck.

My Solution:

I have used ES6 to represent the class of deck and its function shuffle and deal.

Demo: https://shefaligupta.github.io/deck-of-cards/demo/

Test Cases: Open console to see test messages (described in PASS/FAIL).

Shuffle Cards:
When the html file is opened, you will see a shuffle cards button and ordered cards.
Hit the button to display the shuffled cards.

How are cards shuffled: We find a random number from the deck of cards and swap the card from that index.

Deal Card:
Deal card will always pick the top card of the stack. A card will be shown when you hit deal card button on the screen.
